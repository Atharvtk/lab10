## **Dataset Overview**

The **mtcars** dataset, originally published in the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine, contains data on **32 automobiles** with **11 variables** describing aspects such as mileage, horsepower, weight, and engine specifications.  

It is widely used in **R** for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning practice. The dataset helps explore relationships between continuous variables—for example, how a car’s **weight (wt)** and **horsepower (hp)** affect its **mileage (mpg)**.  

Thanks to its simplicity and purely numeric structure, **mtcars** serves as an ideal dataset for learning **linear regression**, **correlation analysis**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
